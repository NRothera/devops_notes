##Brief

Here is my profile page.
It is split into 3 sections.

1. About me
2. Experience and Education
3. Contact Information.

I used normal HTML for the about me section, and bootstrap for the experience and education section to make nice, neat tables.

Things that went well! I think my navbars are good,I like the position and styling of my profile picture. 

I also like the table layout of my experience and education section.

Things that could be better.

I haven't used the empty space in the about me section very well, I could use either more information or better styling.
The tables also start to go wrong at the smallest size of screen,so later on I need to figure out a way to solve that. 
When I add more information to experience and education it may ruin the styling so maybe change that as well.
