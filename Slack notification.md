## Set GitHub username

In order for your computer to know your username on GitHub, you must first set it in the terminal.  


The command is as follows:  `git config --global user.name <GIT_USERNAME>`

e.g `git config --global user.name ExampleName` 

When you submit a pull request, it will search for your GitHub name, if it can't find it it will instead use your computer user name.
